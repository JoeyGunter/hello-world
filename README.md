# hello-world

Hello Humans,

After working in a Design Engineering career for the last three and a half years (using several CAD systems as well as engineering calculations) I have a new passion for coding. This started from create small codes for the CAD programs we were using to help with repetitive tasks. After creating more and more codes and helpful buttons I realised I enjoyed this far more than my main duties my job required.

I learnt a bit of C++ at University for a year (this being back in 2008). Using this basic coding knowledge plus self-teaching I hope to create a website portfolio for myself.

My mission is to obtain a Junior/Graduate developer job ASAP.
